This is a training project on using TypeScritp for building react components.

The sample components are created topic wise.

The individual topic components are configured in index.js. 

In order to use specific component example please uncomment the import statement 
and react integration code and comment the ones which are not needed.

If we enable more than one component at a time, react will consider the latest added component 
and will ignore all previous components added. Please enable only one component to use this code.
